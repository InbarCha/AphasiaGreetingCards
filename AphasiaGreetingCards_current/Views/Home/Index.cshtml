                This is a web application created for aphasics. <br />
                Aphasia is an inability to comprehend or formulate language because of damage to specific brain regions. <br />
                The difficulties of people with aphasia can range from occasional trouble finding words, <br />
                to losing the ability to speak, read, or write; intelligence, however, is unaffected. <br />

                    As a result, many aphasics have difficulty creating gretting-cards for their friends and family. <br />
                    This application's purpose is to help them in this wonderful task.
